                <p>Here, history whispers softly, Of a statesmanâ€™s final rest, His story etched in architecture, A testament to Mughal zest.
                    The flame tree blooms in vibrant hues, A fiery crown above, Its blossoms like a phoenixâ€™s plume, Symbolizing undying love.
                    Visitors wander in awe, As daylight dances through, The leaves cast patterns on the path, A dappled shade of golden hue.
                    The tomb, a bridge across the time, Connects the then and now, A place where past and present meet, Beneath the flame treeâ€™s bough.
